            Do you make lots of donations to charity? Or do you prefer to give every now and then? Whichever you choose,
            you can make your giving easier with <SPAN id="red">Spreading LOVE.</SPAN>

            There are so many amazing charities to support so with all your giving in one place, it’s easier to keep
            track. And, when you open an account, if you’re a BD taxpayer, there’s only one Gift Aid Declaration to
            complete. We arrange for the Gift Aid to go into your account so you have even more to donate at no extra
            cost to you. You can choose to donate those extra funds to the charities you want to.

            <p> There are almost 40 million people suffering people in Bangladesh, one quarter of the people of this
                densely populated country, who remain food insecure, lacking reliable access to enough food to get by,
                not knowing where their next meal may come from.

                These starving people suffer each day and night in this food crisis, with over 5 million children
                suffering severe complications such as stunted growth and malnutrition induced by this lack of basic
                nourishment.
